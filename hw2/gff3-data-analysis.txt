1. Tell us a bit about the organism.

    In GFF3, the #! specifies information about the species being annotated. We can get the accession ID, which is GCA_000280705.1.
    With a quick google search on the accession ID, we can access the emsembl information about it. The link is: https://useast.ensembl.org/Jaculus_jaculus/Info/Annotation
    The Lesser Egyptian jerboa is a small rodent native to Africa and the Middle East. It primarily feeds on seeds and grasses and requires minimal water to survive.

6. Having analyzed this GFF file, does it seem like a complete and well-annotated organism?

    I think this is an incomplete annotation. The only feature types are shown in the output below. 
    We are missing features such as enhancers, promoters, SNPs, repeats, transposable elements.

    Steps:
    a. Go to home directory:
    cd ~

    b. Create a week2 folder
    mkdir week2

    c. Go to week2 folder
    cd week2

    d. Download Jaculus jaculus GFF3 gzip file
    wget https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_gff3/jaculus_jaculus/Jaculus_jaculus.JacJac1.0.112.gff3.gz

    e. Unzip the GFF3 file
    gunzip Jaculus_jaculus.JacJac1.0.112.gff3.gz

    f. List all feature types and their counts
    cat Jaculus_jaculus.JacJac1.0.112.gff3 | grep -v '#' | cut -f 3 | sort-uniq-count-rank
